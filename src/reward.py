    Implementation:
    1. Split text into syllables using Sanskrit phonological rules
    2. Look for repetitive patterns like:
       - Same syllable repeated multiple times (e.g., 'गा गा गा')
       - Same morpheme repeated unnaturally
    3. Calculate a penalty score based on repetition ratio

    """Reward Hacking Part 2: Verify semantic relevance to the topic using multiple approaches.
    
    Implementation:
    1. Keyword density check:
       - Define topic-specific keyword sets (e.g., for 'spring': ['कुसुम', 'मधु', 'वसन्त', ...])
       - Check for presence of multiple related terms
       
    2. LLM-based semantic similarity:
       - Use embeddings to compute similarity between text and topic description
       - Ensure multiple topic-related concepts are present
       
    3. Coherence check:
       - Verify logical flow and connection between ideas
       - Penalize disconnected or random keyword insertions

       - References to the poem itself
       - Self-praise or quality claims
       - Direct addresses to critics/readers
       
    2. Text cleaning:
       - Strip or mask self-referential phrases
       - Focus scoring on actual poetic content
       
    3. Pattern matching:
       - Use regex or token patterns to identify problematic phrases
       - Apply penalties based on severity and frequency

    Implementation:
    1. N-gram comparison:
       - Generate n-grams from input text (n=3,4,5)
       - Compare against n-grams from known corpus
       - Calculate overlap ratios
       
    2. Sequence alignment:
       - Look for longest common subsequences
       - Identify partial matches and adaptations
       
    3. Similarity thresholds:
       - Set acceptable levels of similarity
       - Consider legitimate reuse of common phrases
       - Penalize based on extent of overlap
